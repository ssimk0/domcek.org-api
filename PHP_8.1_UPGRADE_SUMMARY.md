# PHP 8.1 Upgrade Summary

## Overview
Your Laravel 8 project has been prepared for PHP 8.1 compatibility. This document summarizes all changes made and next steps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Composer Configuration (composer.json:12)
- **Updated:** PHP version requirement from `"^7.3|^8.0"` to `"^7.3|^8.0|^8.1"`
- **Reason:** Allow composer to install PHP 8.1 compatible packages

### 2. Critical PHP 8.1 Compatibility Fixes

#### app/Services/ParticipantService.php:269
- **Fixed:** String concatenation operator
- **Before:** `'Problem with register user ' + json_encode($user)`
- **After:** `'Problem with register user ' . json_encode($user)`
- **Reason:** PHP 8.1 throws TypeError when using `+` for string concatenation

#### app/Services/ParticipantService.php:214-215
- **Fixed:** Null safety for payment number retrieval
- **Before:** Direct property access without null check
- **After:** Added null check before accessing payment_number
- **Reason:** Prevents TypeError when payment is not found

#### app/Http/Controllers/Secure/PaymentController.php:35
- **Fixed:** Array bounds checking
- **Before:** `if (count($parsed) > 1 && trim($parsed[4]) === 'Kredit')`
- **After:** `if (count($parsed) > 13 && isset($parsed[4]) && trim($parsed[4]) === 'Kredit')`
- **Reason:** Ensures all array keys exist before accessing them

### 3. Docker Setup Files Created

#### Dockerfile
- PHP 8.1 FPM base image
- All required PHP extensions (pdo_mysql, mbstring, exif, pcntl, bcmath, gd, zip)
- wkhtmltopdf for PDF generation (required by laravel-snappy)
- Composer installed
- Proper directory structure and permissions

#### docker-compose.yml
- **app** service: PHP 8.1 application container
- **nginx** service: Web server on port 8000
- **db** service: MySQL 8.0 database
- Persistent volume for database data
- Proper networking between containers

#### setup.sh
- Automated setup script that:
  - Builds and starts containers
  - Updates composer dependencies
  - Generates application key
  - Sets proper permissions
  - Verifies PHP version

#### DOCKER_SETUP.md
- Complete documentation for Docker usage
- Quick start guide
- Useful commands
- Troubleshooting tips

#### .dockerignore
- Excludes unnecessary files from Docker build
- Improves build performance

## Additional Issues Identified (Not Critical)

The codebase scan identified several other potential PHP 8.1 compatibility issues that are **not critical** but should be addressed eventually:

### High Priority
- **app/Services/EventService.php:212-223** - Unsafe `Arr::get()` property access
- **app/Services/PaymentService.php:30,39** - `intval()` on potentially null values
- **app/Services/UserService.php:92-93** - `boolval()` type conversions

### Medium Priority
- **app/Repositories/Repository.php** - Array filtering patterns
- **app/Repositories/ParticipantRepository.php** - Array slicing patterns

These issues will produce warnings but won't crash the application. They can be fixed as part of future maintenance.

## How to Test

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d --build

# 2. Update dependencies for PHP 8.1
docker-compose exec app composer update

# 3. Generate app key
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# 4. Run migrations
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate

# 5. Access the application
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Important Notes

1. **Composer Lock File:** The `composer.lock` file will be updated when you run `composer update`. This is expected and necessary for PHP 8.1 compatibility.

2. **JWT Package:** The project uses `tymon/jwt-auth` which will be updated to a PHP 8.1 compatible version automatically.

3. **Database Connection:** The Docker setup includes MySQL 8.0. Make sure your `.env` file has:
   ```
   DB_HOST=db
   DB_DATABASE=domcek
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=root
   ```

4. **Vendor Directory:** The vendor directory is mounted as a volume, so changes persist between container restarts.

5. **Laravel Version:** Laravel 8 fully supports PHP 8.1, so no framework upgrades are needed.

## Verification Checklist

After running the setup:

- [ ] Containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] PHP version is 8.1: `docker-compose exec app php -v`
- [ ] Composer dependencies updated successfully
- [ ] Application key generated in `.env`
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Application accessible at http://localhost:8000
- [ ] No critical errors in logs: `docker-compose logs -f app`

## Troubleshooting

### Composer Update Fails
If composer update fails due to dependency conflicts:
```bash
docker-compose exec app composer update --with-all-dependencies
```

### Permission Errors
If you get permission errors:
```bash
docker-compose exec app chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
docker-compose exec app chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

### Container Won't Start
Check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs app
docker-compose logs nginx
docker-compose logs db
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the setup script or manual setup commands
2. Test your application thoroughly
3. Run your test suite: `docker-compose exec app php artisan test`
4. Check application logs for any deprecation warnings
5. Consider fixing the non-critical issues listed above

## Rollback

If you need to rollback:
```bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down

# The original code is unchanged on your host machine
# Just don't commit the composer.json changes if you want to stay on PHP 8.0
```
